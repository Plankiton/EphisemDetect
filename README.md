## Subject

In order to aid in the diagnosis of lung emphysema, which are a major component of
Chronic Obstructive Pulmonary Disease (COPD), the fourth leading cause of death in
the world, automatic methods of four emphysema subtypes classification and its five
severity levels were developed from High Resolution Computed Tomography (HRCT)
images of the lungs, through Digital Image Processing (PDI), which has facilitated
progress in numerous medicine areas. Use texture analysis or the Local Binary
Standard (LBP) as attribute extraction techniques from three lung imaging datasets
and regions of interest (ROI) in a standard dataset global, as well as recognition of
emphysema subtypes and its severity levels through Optimum-Path Forest (OPF) or
Multilayer Perceptron (MLP) classifiers. An extraction of characteristics by Local
Binary Pattern generated more discriminating data for classification than texture
analysis.

The LBP-MLP method obtained results higher than the LBP-OPF method
and even compared with the state-of-art, with 100% accuracy in the classification of
emphysema subtypes and also of the emphysema severity levels, for all four banks of
images, including the global dataset, even when combined. LBP-MLP demonstrates
an automatic, effective, efficient and robust method that can reduce the variability and
diagnosis time of emphysema, not only assisting radiologists in the interpretation of
medical images, as well as promoting the anatomical knowledge level of this disease
in regions where two-thirds of the world population has limited access to radiologists,
because attention is required by the dangerous and generalized nature.
